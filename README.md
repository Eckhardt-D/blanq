# Blanq - The Nuxt Nuxt Starter

Blanq is a project to get a Nuxt app up and running as quick as possible. The project uses an opinionated list of packages, configurations, vendors and services.
The idea is to be able just to replace some items in the `app.config.ts` and have the basis for your app set up.

Instead of having to always rewrite stuff like:

- Authentication
- Common Database schema and ORM setup
- Email sending
- File uploading
- Queues
- Stripe Payments / Products / Subscriptions

You have it out of the box, ready to be tweaked for your needs.
